        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>The Renderer uses Smarty Template Engine — one of the most popular and mature template engines.</p>

        <p>Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically,
            it facilitates a manageable way to separate application logic and content from its presentation.<br>
            This is best described in a situation where the application programmer and the template designer play
            different roles.

        <p>Smarty Template Engine is used for rendering and cache management, it has neither override nor fall-back mechanism.

        <p>The Render engine ensures compatibility with legacy themes of XOOPS2 and XOOPS2-JP.

        <p>Templates are built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Smarty tags<br>
        — Smarty is used with custom delimiters very similar to HTML markup language that make it easier to design and develop components.</p>

        <div class="tips">The Renderer implementation of Smarty uses custom delimiters <b class="badge">&lt;{</b> ... <b class="badge">}&gt;</b><br>
            instead of Smarty code enclosed in curly brace tag delimiters {$var} of the official documentation.</div>

        <p>The <b>Template Management</b> allows you to enable a <b>Template Set</b> and check the list of <b>templates</b> that you can edit, copy, download or delete.
        You can manage files more easily, even when they’re not all stored in one central folder or directory.
        Although, some Themes have a template directory including most, if not all template files to meet an organization's needs for customization and personalization.

        <p>For general instructions about the Smarty language, visit <a href="https://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/ ⭧</a>

    <h3>Banner Management</h3>

        <p>Allows you to manage banners and display ads in your website.

        <p>You can place a banner of any type, in any location of the page, and on any module.

        <p>You may show a banner to visitors a certain number of impressions.

        <p>An impression is a metric used to quantify the number of digital views of a client banner.

        <h4>Banner Smarty Tags</h4>

        <p>Smarty generates web content through the placement of special Smarty tags within a document.

        <p>The Banner tags can be added to Themes, Templates or Blocks.

        <p>Smarty tags will be processed and substituted with content.

    <h5>Banner Random Display</h5>

    <pre><code class="lang-smarty">
    &lt;{$xoops_banner}&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <h5>Display Banner if not empty</h5>

    &lt;{if $xoops_banner and $xoops_banner!=&quot;&quot;}&gt;&lt;{$xoops_banner}&gt;&lt;{/if}&gt;

    <h5>Display a specific Banner Id (bid)</h5>

        <h3>Banner Client Management</h3>

        <p>Assigning a banner to a particular client will help in the long run if you’re working with several clients (i.e. customers).
        If you’re only going to have one or two banners, you may not need to create a banner client.

        <h4>Steps for creating a new client</h4>
        <p>To setup a new banner client, follow the steps below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Click the button New Banner Client
            <li>Enter all the details for your new banner client:
            <li>Name and Contact
            <li>Client Email and Password (only access Banners impression)
            <li>After doing so, click Submit.
        </ul>

        <h3>Cool URI .htaccess</h3>

        <p>This feature generates a htaccess file to use Cool URI

        <p>1. Copy the generated code

        <p>2. Create a file /public_html/.htaccess

        <p>3. Past the generated code into .htaccess</p>

        <p>4. Enable "Cool URI" in the Control Panel System  <a href="../../legacy/admin/index.php?action=PreferenceEdit&confcat_id=1">🆒 Settings ⭢</a>

        <h3>The .htaccess File</h3>

        <p><b>.htaccess</b> files are plain-text configuration files used by the Apache HTTP web server.
            They allow users to set directory level options without requiring access to the httpd.conf file,
            including www rewrite, hotlink prevention, custom error pages, caching, and redirects.<br>
            As such it is required that your server uses Apache, and a web host that allows htaccess files (the most popular hosts do).

    <section id="help-template">

        <h3>Template Management</h3>

        <p>The list of Template Sets is displayed in Template Management.

        <p>The distribution package comes with a Default Template Set.

        <p>When modules are installed, their templates become part of this Default Template set.

        <div class="error">The Default <b>Template Set</b> cannot be deleted nor modified !</div>

        <p>To customize the templates in your site, first create a new <b>Template Set</b>

        <p>Copy the templates you want to customize from the default template set to your new template set.

        <p>Once you have a new Template Set, you can activate it by clicking the "Select" button in the Control column.

        <p>Only then template files can be edited in the Template File Management.

        <h3>Template File Management</h3>

        <p>The list of template files allow download and editing of each file.</p>

        <div class="tips">You can upload Template Set archives in tar format through the admin interface.</div>

    <section id="help-themes">

        <h3>Theme Selection</h3>

        <p>Theme Management allows you to simple click the "Select" button next to the theme
            that you want to use as the default theme or main theme of your site.

        <p>Any theme that is "checked" in the "Control" column, will be available to users in the block "Themes".

        <p>If you install the "Themes" block and grant users permission, they can then select their favorite theme and customize the look and feel of the website.

        <h3>Install a Theme</h3>

        <p>Distributed themes are mostly compressed.
            To use a theme, the uncompressed files must be uploaded into the directory public_html/themes/.

        <p>The Theme folder must include theme.html and manifesto.ini.php

        <p>Additional Themes can be installed from X-Update Store, from theme-developers' websites or your custom design.

        <h3>Uninstall a Theme</h3>

        <p>The render system manages themes without using the database.

        <p>So, to delete a theme, simply delete its directory from the "themes" directory.

        <h3>AMP HTML Specification</h3>

        <p>AMP HTML is a subset of HTML for authoring content pages such as news articles in a way that guarantees certain baseline performance characteristics.
            Being a subset of HTML, it puts some restrictions on the full set of tags and functionality available through HTML,
            but it does not require the development of new rendering engines: existing user agents can render AMP HTML just like all other HTML.</p>
        <p>Also, AMP HTML documents can be uploaded to a web server and served just like any other HTML document; no special configuration for the server is necessary.
            However, they are also designed to be optionally served through specialized AMP serving systems that proxy AMP documents.</p>

        <h3>BBCode</h3>

        <p>BBCode is a simple way to format your entries (like bold text, italic text, links) in forums.
            BBCode was implemented as method of providing a safer and easier way of allowing posts to be formatted on forums.</p>

        <h3>Formatting Posts</h3>
        <p>BBCode is short for Bulletin Board Code. It is used as a way for formatting posts made on message boards, blogs and more.
            It is similar to HTML in the sense that in BBCode one does also use tags to format something specific (contained within the tag).
            In BBCode tags are indicated by rectangular brackets surrounding a keyword, which is in turn transformed into HTML before being delivered to a web browser.

            Since its creation, BBCode has been used in many different portals. Any developer can implement it for free and anyone can use it.

        <h3>Markdown</h3>

        <p>Markdown is a tool that converts simple text characters into HTML. It was created to facilitate writing on the web.
        It is very similar in purpose to BBCode, being created later (in 2004).
        Unlike BBCode, Markdown aims to avoid the use of tags wherever possible, as if the writing was just plain text.

        <h3>Markdown vs BBCode</h3>

        <p>In general, Markdown is not necessarily a competitor to BBCode, just a different and complementary way of writing on the web, which may be more suitable in certain contexts.
        <p>In general, the writing difficulty can be ordered like this:

        <p><code>Text < Markdown < BBCode < HTML</code></p>

        <p>The further to the right, the more features, and the further to the left, the simpler.
        <p>Markdown usage requires the installation of a plugin, preload or module.</p>
