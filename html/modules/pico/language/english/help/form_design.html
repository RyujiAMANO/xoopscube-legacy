        <h3>
            Extending features of pico by smarty plugins(1)
        </h3>


        <p>Now, I show a practical examples how to use pico's formmail system.

        Case 1:<br>
        "Implant forms after product presentation pages"<br>

        You can easily achive it using pico's smarty plugisn "pico" and "formmail".<br>

        Make a content like this. (Turn "Smarty" filter on)</p>


        <h4>(products introducing section)</h4>

<pre><code class="lanh-html"></code></pre>

<pre><code class="lang-smarty">
&lt;{capture}&gt;
&lt;{pico id=&quot;(content ID describing the form)&quot;}&gt;
&lt;{/capture}&gt;
&lt;{formmail4fleamarket mail_body_pre=&quot;A query from visitor existsnContact him/her soon as possiblenn&quot; from_name=&quot;Product manager&quot; cc_field_name=&quot;youremail&quot; cc_mail_subject=&quot;A confirmation for your query&quot; cc_mail_body_pre=&quot;Thank you for querying us.nThis is the content you have queriedn&quot;}&gt;
</code></pre>


<p>Also, you have to make a content like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">
&lt;form&gt;
name: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; class=&quot;required&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
email: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;youremail&quot; class=&quot;email&quot; /&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>This content ID(number) will be specified the former content.
        You can make a variety of forms, and specify their numbers as you like.
<br>
        Of course, you can make form contents into the other pico module instance.
        You can specify the form content by "dirname" parameter.h <code class="lang-smarty">&lt;{pico id=&quot;(conent ID)&quot; dirname=&quot;(dirname)&quot;}&gt;</code>
<br>
        Now we look long parameters of <code class="lang-smarty">&lt;{formmail}&gt;</code><br>
        Their parameters controls "mail actions".<br>
<br>
        legend)
        mail_body_pre: specifying body part before the query content. (from XOOPS to adminmail)<br>
        from_name: specifying sender name<br>
        cc_field_name: specifying a field name for sending "confirming mail" to form poster.<br>
        cc_mail_subject: specifying Subject of "confirming mail"<br>
            cc_mail_body_pre: specifying body part before the query content of "confirming mail"</p>
