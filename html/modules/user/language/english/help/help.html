        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>The User module provides the best practices ensuring you have a simple, secure and scalable account authentication system.
        <p>This module allows you to manage users, groups, and set permissions defined in the default security realm.

        <p>The following features are provided:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>User Registration</li>
            <li>User Profile Edit</li>
            <li>User Profile Display</li>
            <li>Blocks about users</li>
            <li>User Management</li>
            <li>others</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Identity-Based Security</h3>

        <p>The most common form of Identity-based security is password authentication involving the login of an online account.
            Most of the largest digital corporations rely on this form of security, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.

        <h3>Group-Based Policy</h3>

        <p>Groups are used to segment users in your web application by grouping the users into roles based on user authentication.

        <p>User and group-based policies are designed to facilitate the assignment of security permissions to multiple user accounts, improving security and productivity.

        <p>Typically, you create a User Group to represent a group of users.
            By granting security permissions to the User Group, you can reduce the need to configure security permissions for individual user accounts.</p>
        <p>You can manage permissions directly in User Groups Management,
            or you can manage them 'remotely' by associating them within Modules and blocks permissions.
            Either way, you need to create the User Groups you require directly in User Groups Management.</p>

        <p>When you first install the Web Application Platform, the only User Groups that exists are the built-in required groups :

        <ul>
        <li>Webmasters
        <li>Registered Users
        <li>Anonymous<br>
        The user group which by default does not have any permissions.
        </ul>

        <p>When you assign a User account to a User Group, that user becomes a 'member' of the User Group.<br>
            A user can be a member of more than one User Group.<br>
            This can make managing security permissions easier because you can configure different user groups to provide access to different collections of security permissions.<br>
            By adding or removing a user's membership of different User Groups, you can allocate or remove that user's access to the collections
            of security permissions to which those particular User Groups provide access.</p>

        <p>When a user logs on via a user account that is a 'member' of a User Group, that user is granted:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>The permissions of the ‘Registered Users’ User Group
        <li>The permissions of the user account
        <li>The permissions of the User Group(s) of which the user account is a member
        <li>The permissions of any role that is assigned to the user account, e.g. moderator.
        <li>The permissions of any D3 module individual permissions that are assigned to the User
        <li>Access to any modules and contents that are associated with the User Group(s)
        <li>Access to any blocks and contents that are associated with the User Group(s)
        <li>Access to any D3 modules contents that are associated with the User Account.
        </ul>

    </section>


    <section id="help-groups">

        <h3>Group Management</h3>

        <P>Identity-based are attached to a user account, group, or role. These policies let you specify what actions that identity, user or user-group is allowed to do (its permissions).
            Groups are additive, which means that identity is the sum (or conjunction) of all the groups to which the user belongs.
        <p>The group membership remains independently of the session (the logging session).<br>
            Any notion of inheritance or exclusion must be handled manually by someone with enough privileges to manage group membership.</p>
        <p>You can assign users to more than one group and grant access to the content of modules and blocks.</p>

        <p>The installation wizard creates the default Groups and Roles :</p>

        <table>
            <tr><td>Webmasters</td><td>Administrators</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Registered Users</td><td>Members</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Anonymous Users</td><td>Guests</td></tr>
            <tr><td colspan="2"><b>Roles</b></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Webmaster</td><td>Administration</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Moderator</td><td>Forum moderation</td></tr>
        </table>

        <div class="error">These required User Groups and Roles can not be deleted !<br>
            You can create new Groups and modify the permissions for each new Group created.</div>

        <h3>Roles</h3>

        <p>Roles are used to add privileges to specific users, for example :
        <ul>
            <li>Webmaster - can assign users and permissions
            <li>Moderator - can manage only comments and forums
        </ul>

        <div class="confirm">D3 modules, or Trust modules can assign individual permissions.</div>

        <p>The Permissions section of D3Forum, and other Trust modules, allow you to select the checkboxes that correspond
            to the privileges you can grant to a specific user i.e. View, Post, Edit, etc.</p>

        <div class="tips">Consider your security and access needs, set Groups according to those needs,
        then add users to the Groups based on the permissions that you want to grant.</div>

        <p>Bulk actions or bulk editing is an efficient way to complete certain actions to multiple items at one time as opposed to completing the same action multiple times.
            For example, you can perform a bulk action to disable or delete multiple users at the same time.
            Actions that involve a unique identifier, such as setting a user's permission level for a content, should not be completed through bulk editing if each user requires separate settings.
            Some actions can only be completed at the individual item level. The Actions button only appears in modules that allow for bulk editing.

        <h3>User Management</h3>

        <p>Access to your website is controlled by a group system by which users are assigned to User groups.
            Group permissions allow access to the content of modules and blocks.</p>

        <p>D3 modules, or Trust modules, can extend User Management by providing a role-based system to assign individual permissions.</p>

        <div class="confirm">A user's permissions are determined by the sum of all group permissions to which the user belongs.</div>

        <h3>User Account</h3>

        <p>A user account has login information, authentication and profile fields by default.
            Login credentials, typically a username and password, authenticate a user logging into an account.</p>

        <p>User accounts are added through user registration and activation.
            Although webmasters can create accounts in the User Management.

        <p>The user profile can also be extended by adding new fields with the Profile module.</p>

        <h3>Module Blocks</h3>

        <h4 class='highlight_block_name'>Login</h4>

        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>This module block shows the login-form for only anonymous users who still are not passing the authentication.
            If the user registration is allowed, it shows the link to create an account.
            And, if the SSL login is allowed, it shows the link specified by options of preferences.</p>

        <p>Create An Account is what the anonymous user do after the sign-up.
            An account needs to be associated with a signature or profile, and often that can't be done until the user completes the registration process.
        That registration process may require them to agree to the “Terms and Conditions” : that's the sign-up part.

        <h3>Mail Job</h3>

        <p>The mail job allows you to create job definitions that send simple email, or notifications.
            You can use MailJob to inform users of events, for example :
        <ul>
            <li>User conferences.
            <li>Networking events.
            <li>Learning Workshops.
            <li>Community events.
            <li>Outdoors activities.
            <li>Auctions and Pop-up shops.
            <li>Special guest events.
        </ul>

        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>Add an empty job from the control panel.
        <p>Specify a name and a label for the job.
        <p>In a next step invoke the job wizard to find users. The wizard brings up the following window :
        <p>Search Users filter according to various criteria.
        <p>Then, you can manage the job messages to users :
        <p>Retry, resubmit, and expiration.
        <p>You can customize the maximum number of retries.
        <p>This gives you the option to continue processing new events.

        <h3>Preferences</h3>

        <h5>Features in Control Panel</h5>
        <p>This article provides information specific to user management.</p>

        <h4>User module - Preferences</h4>

        <h5>Allow new user registration?</h5>
        <p>Specifies whether anonymous users can register to your site. If YES, registration is available, and <span class='highlight_block_name'>Login Block</span> shows the link to create an account (register.php).
        <p>Even if registration is deactivated, you can still add a new user in the user management.</p>

        <h5>Minimum length of password required</h5>
        <p>Specifies the minimum password length. A long password makes a password harder to guess. Of course, length is only one strong password factor. But, you should specify at least five.</p>

        <h5>Minimum length of username required</h5>
        <p>Specifies the minimum username length. This option is not about security. This is a decision to be made based on the needs of your organization.</p>

        <h5>Allow users to change email address?</h5>
        <p>Specifies whether users can change their email address in user profile editor (edituser.php). By the way, this module does not send a confirmation email for users who change their email address.</p>

        <h5>Notify by mail when a new user is registered?</h5>
        <p>If this option is Yes, the group specified by the following option can receive an e-mail notification about new user registrations.</p>

        <h5>Select a group to which new user notification mail will be sent</h5>
        <p>Specifies the group that receives the notification mail in case the previous option is Yes. The webmaster group is usually selected for this option.</p>

        <h5>Select activation type of newly registered users</h5>
        <p>After registering, a user must be activated. Being activated means being able to log in. There are several ways to activate users.</p>

        <h6>Require activation by user</h6>
        <p>This is far and away the most popular setting in the world of website systems. A user gets an activation email when they register. They are then able to login by clicking on the activation URL on the mail. This choice is satisfactory in most cases.</p>

        <h6>Activate automatically</h6>
        <p>In simple terms, there is really no activation mechanism, everyone is activated straight away. But, if you use it, you have to be careful of internet bots.
            An Internet bot, web crawler, bot, or simply bot, is a software application that performs automated tasks over the Internet. A bot can auto-register and SPAM. Therefore, this choice is only recommended for a closed segment.</p>

        <h6>Activation by administrators</h6>
        <p>A user can only be activated by direct approval of the group specified by the following option. This activation requires human intervention, and therefore seems more effective. However, this can be a time-consuming task for activators.</p>

        <h5>Select the level of strictness for username filtering</h5>
        <p>Select the strictness level for the username from the following options.</p>

        <h6>Strict (Only alphabets and numbers)</h6>
        <p>This option only allows the following characters for username.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alphabets without case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>Numbers.</li>
            <li>Under score (_).</li>
            <li>Hyphen (-).</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Medium</h6>
        <p>This option allows the following characters for username.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alphabets without case-sensitive.</li>
            <li>Numbers</li>
            <li>Underscore(_).</li>
            <li>Hyphen(-).</li>
            <li>Less than character(&lt;).</li>
            <li>Greater than character(&gt;).</li>
            <li>Comma(,).</li>
            <li>Period(.).</li>
            <li>Dollar($).</li>
            <li>Percent(%).</li>
            <li>Sharp(#).</li>
            <li>At sign(@).</li>
            <li>Exclamation point(!).</li>
            <li>Single quotation(').</li>
            <li>Double quotation(&quot;).</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Light - allow 2byte characters</h6>
        <p>This option allows all characters except control code. But this can be a cause of problem for some modules. Therefore, this option is not recommended if you are using old modules.</p>

        <h5>Allow custom avatar upload?</h5>
        <p>Specifies whether a user can upload their favorite image file as an avatar. Even if the case is No, a user can choose an avatar among the avatars made available by the administrators.</p>

        <h5>Minimum posts required</h5>
        <p>If you allow uploading of custom avatars, you don't need to set this option.</p>

        <p>This is the minimum number of posts required for users to upload a custom avatar. This decision depends on your organization's community member ranking strategy.</p>

        <h5>Avatar image max width (pixel)</h5>

        <p>Define if custom avatar upload is allowed.</p>

        <h5>Allow users to delete own account?</h5>
        <p>Specifies whether users can delete their own account in the user profile edit.
            If Yes, users can access the account deletion dialog via the user profile link (userinfo.php).
            Since these delete dialogs are very minimal, you can improve it with a notice by changing the templates --- user_delete.html, user_delete_success.html.</p>

        <h5>Execution confirmation message</h5>
        <p>This is the message displayed in the account deletion dialog. If you don't allow users to delete their own account, you don't need to edit this option.</p>

        <h5>Enter names that should not be selected as username</h5>
        <p>These are patterns that your site does not allow as usernames. Separate them with a | (pipe). This is case-insensitive and regex enabled.
            This rule does not apply to user management in the control panel. If you don't allow users to delete their own account, you don't need to edit this option.

        <h5>Enter emails that should not be used in user profile</h5>
        <p>These are patterns that your site does not allow as email address. Separate them with a | (pipe). This is case-insensitive and regex enabled.
            This rule does not apply to user management in the control panel.</p>

        <h5>Display disclaimer?</h5>
        <p>Specify whether the user registration displays the disclaimer specified by the following option.</p>

        <h5>Registration disclaimer</h5>
        <p>This is the disclaimer stated in the user registration for the anonymous user. If the previous option is No, you do not need to edit this option.</p>

        <h5>Name for user cookies</h5>
        <p>Specifies the cookie name for web browsers. In most of the cases, you don't need to change this.</p>

        <h5>Use SSL for login?</h5>
        <p>You need to install the additional login script to enable SSL connection. If YES, <span class="highlight_block_name">Login Block</span> shows the link "SSL Login".
            These options are for compatibility with XOOPS2-JP. You may be able to find a better solution to upgrade and migrate your SSL connection. The script is in the public "/html" directory.</p>

        <h5>SSL Post variable name</h5>
        <p>This option is for SSL Login, too. Specifies a name of the POST-request variable.</p>

        <h5>URL where SSL login page is located</h5>
        <p>This option is for SSL Login, too. Specifies the URL where you have installed the additional login script for SSL.</p>
