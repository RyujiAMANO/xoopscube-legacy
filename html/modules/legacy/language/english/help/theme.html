        <p>The Renderer uses Smarty Template Engine —one of the most popular and mature template engines.</p>

        <p>Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically,
            it facilitates a manageable way to separate application logic and content from its presentation.

        <p>This is best described in a situation where the application programmer and the template designer play
            different roles, or in most cases are not the same person.

        <p>The Render engine (renderer) ensures compatibility with legacy themes of XOOPS2 and XOOPS2-JP.

        <p>Smarty Template Engine is used for rendering and cache management, it has neither override nor fall-back mechanism.

        <p>The renderer uses a theme file "manifesto.ini.php" for specs and details.

        <p>The simplest theme requires only one file: theme.html, and optionally style.css to
            control the style. You can use only theme.html, style.css and manifesto.ini.php to build your theme.

        <p>The directory /html/themes/ holds the public default theme.
        <p>The directory /html/modules/legacy/admin/theme the admin theme and backend templates.
        <p>Themes are built with HTML, CSS, JavScript and Smarty with custom delimiters
            similar to HTML markup language that make easier to design and develop components for themes and modules templates.</p>
