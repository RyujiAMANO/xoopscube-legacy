## Usage

### Post-installation checklist

Once the installation wizard completed, your website is preconfigured with default configuration settings. These settings refer to the pre-existing value of a user-configurable setting that is assigned to your web application platform. Therefore, you need to perform some post-installation tasks before launching your new website. These include setting up the site name and slogan, customizing meta tags (SEO), allowing visitors to register, and user group permissions. More detailed documents are available and highlighted throughout the built-in Help.

- From the Admin Control Panel, set your preferences (your site is closed by default)
- Install modules, blocks or create custom blocks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript or PHP) to specific modules pages
- Create new user groups and set permissions
- Customize meta tags (SEO)
- Manage translations and localization
